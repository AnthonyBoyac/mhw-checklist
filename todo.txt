  - A Rank Arena quests - not challenges
  - Copy MHW layout for kinsect (look at tree, hover function, etc.)
  - Make a video showing how to unlock specialized tools (with subtitles)
  - Add crowns images for table data in 'Crowns' nav
  - Add description prop to each component explaining what each table consist of
    - eg: to unlock all room decor, complete all main story quests, optional quests from housekeeper, photography,
    research requests, deliveries, treasure tips, endemic life, and fishing bounties
